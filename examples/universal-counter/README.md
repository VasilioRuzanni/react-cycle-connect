# Universal react-native Cycle app with react-cycle-connect

Simple example/boilerplate to demonstrate:

- Using cycle.js with react-native and react-native-web via expo.
- Use `react-cycle-connect` to decouple dataflow from view components
- With updated fork of `react-cycle-component` to work with `@cycle/state`
- Simple example with:
  - counter component loaded as top level component.
  - Isolated components with simple lenses and `@cycle/state`
- Works with ios, android and web.
- Uses `react-router` for universal routing.
